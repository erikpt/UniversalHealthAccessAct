### Medicare Covered Services: Parts A, B, and D (as of 2026)

Medicare coverage for 2026 is based on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines, with no major changes to core benefits from 2025. Part A and B form "Original Medicare," while Part D is for prescriptions. Below is a comprehensive list of covered services under each part, drawn from the official CMS "Medicare & You 2026" handbook and related publications. Coverage requires medical necessity (determined by providers), and costs include deductibles, coinsurance, and premiums. Preventive services are often free. This is not exhaustive for every nuance (e.g., frequency limits like one mammogram per year); consult Medicare.gov for specifics.
