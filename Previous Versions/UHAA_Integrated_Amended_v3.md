# Revised Universal Healthcare Access Act of 2026 (UHAA) — Integrated Draft v3
*(Core‑CPI, Four‑Pillar Financing, National Health Budget & Capital Planning, Program Integrity/Equity, and Conforming Amendments)*

## A Bill to Establish a Hybrid Single-Payer Healthcare System in the United States

**Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,**

---

### SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE
This Act may be cited as the **“Universal Healthcare Access Act of 2026” (UHAA).**

---

### SECTION 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE

#### (a) Findings
Congress finds the following:

1. The current U.S. healthcare system is fragmented, costly, and inefficient, with administrative overhead and insurer profits exceeding $30 billion annually in denied care and net income for major insurers as of 2024.
2. All Americans deserve access to essential healthcare services without financial ruin, regardless of employment, income, or pre‑existing conditions.
3. Single‑payer systems in peer nations demonstrate that universal coverage financed through broad‑based contributions, paired with cost controls, can achieve efficiency and equity.
4. Transitioning to universal coverage in the United States requires a hybrid approach that preserves existing provider networks while simplifying administration and ensuring budget discipline.
5. Oversight should be limited to funding and compliance, not clinical decision‑making by medical professionals.
6. Protecting the system’s integrity requires safeguards against political interference, including protection for dedicated healthcare funds.
7. Income‑based co‑pays may promote responsible utilization while maintaining affordability and equity.
8. Integration of mental health, **dental**, **hearing**, **vision**, and telemedicine services will strengthen outcomes, particularly for rural communities.
9. ERISA‑based employer self‑insurance fragments standards; a unified national approach enhances interstate commerce and consistency.
10. Healthcare is an instrument of interstate commerce, requiring national uniformity and regulatory authority under the Commerce Clause.

#### (b) Purpose
The purpose of this Act is to:
1. Establish a national **Healthcare Trust Fund (HTF)** as the single payer for **essential services**.
2. Preserve a **hybrid** design allowing supplemental private insurance and continued use of **Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)** for non‑essential services.
3. Align financing with scope by **redirecting existing federal and employer health dollars** into the HTF, while enforcing **cost controls** and **core‑CPI‑linked** growth limits.
4. Eliminate profit‑driven denials of essential care and simplify administration.
5. Promote equity through phased integration, anti‑fraud capability, and uniform national standards.

#### (b) Hybrid System and Supplemental Market.
1. The HTF is the primary payer for Essential Services, replacing private insurance for those services.
2. Private insurers may offer **supplemental** coverage for non‑essential services and amenities; they may not deny or delay HTF‑covered services.
3. Employers and individuals transition over five years; low‑income participants receive refundable tax credits for supplemental coverage where appropriate.
4. VA, TRICARE, and IHS remain operational; beneficiaries may opt to integrate with HTF per agency agreements.
5. **Preservation of HSAs.** HSAs may be used for non‑essential services, co‑pays, or other qualified expenses; nothing in this Act restricts new or existing HSAs.
6. **Required Minimum Benefits (Supplemental).** Any supplemental plan offered in the United States shall, at minimum, cover: (A) **dental** (preventive and basic restorative); (B) **adult vision hardware** (lenses/frames annually as clinically appropriate); (C) **hearing aids** (at least every 3 years, or per clinical need); and (D) optional **LTSS riders** meeting HHS standards. Within **12 months**, HHS shall publish **Standardized Supplemental Plans** (SSP‑Basic/SSP‑Enhanced) that meet or exceed these minima with transparent, comparable benefits and cost‑sharing.
7. **Consumer Protections (Supplemental).** Supplemental issuers shall provide: **guaranteed issue**, **no pre‑existing condition exclusions**, **no rescissions**, **community rating within HHS age bands**, **anti‑discrimination** protections consistent with federal civil‑rights laws, and standardized appeals. Each issuer must offer at least one **SSP‑Basic** option in every state where it operates.
8. **Medically Complex Affordability Support.** HHS shall establish **Supplemental Affordability Credits** for **HMCBs** to reduce premiums and cost‑sharing for supplemental benefits. Credits shall be targeted, means‑ and needs‑tested, and **administered within HTF outlay caps** not to exceed **0.2%** of annual HTF outlays, indexed to **Core CPI**.

#### (c) Non‑Resident (Visitor) Billing.

### SECTION 5. FINANCING, NATIONAL HEALTH BUDGET, AND COST CONTROL

#### (a) Four‑Pillar Financing (with SECA parity and anti‑avoidance).
To align revenue with scope and ensure fiscal balance, the HTF is financed through the following consolidated pillars:

1. **UHAA Payroll Contribution (W‑2).**  
   (A) **Employer portion (doubled).** Employer marginal rates:  
   • Up to $200,000 AGI: **9.33%** employer;  
   • $200,001–$500,000: **16%** employer;  
   • $500,001–$1,000,000: **20%** employer;  
   • Over $1,000,000: **24%** employer.  
   (B) **Employee portion.** Employee marginal rates are **capped at 9.5%** and **may not fall below 5%** for individuals/households **at or above 105% of FPL**; those **below 105% FPL** owe **0%**.  
   (C) Contributions apply to all wages and compensation with no upper cap.

2. **Self‑Employed (SECA Parity) and Pass‑Through Anti‑Avoidance.**  
   (A) **SECA mirror.** Self‑employment income is subject to **combined employer+employee UHAA rates equivalent to W‑2** at the applicable marginal brackets, with deductible employer‑equivalent portion as under SECA.  
   (B) **Pass‑through avoidance.** HHS and Treasury shall issue rules to treat **reasonable compensation** for S‑corporation and partnership owners as wage‑like for UHAA contributions; schemes that convert labor income to distributions are disregarded.  
   (C) **Non‑wage health contribution.** For AGI **above $400,000**, net investment income and pass‑through distributions are subject to a **1.0% UHAA non‑wage health contribution**, indexed to **Core CPI**, with de minimis exemptions under $25,000.

3. **Medicare Realignment.**  
   (A) The **Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) payroll tax** and the **existing HI Trust Fund balance** are consolidated into the HTF.  
   (B) **Medicare Parts B and D** general revenue contributions are **redirected** to the HTF, with beneficiary protections maintained.

4. **Medicaid Maintenance of Effort (Medicaid MOE).** Federal and state Medicaid funding streams are **redirected** to the HTF on a maintenance‑of‑effort basis equal to pre‑Act levels, with state contributions indexed to **Core CPI** and adjusted for enrollment.

5. **Employer Maintenance of Effort (Employer MOE) and Automation Dividend Health Contribution (ADHC).**  
   (A) **Employer MOE.** Employers shall remit the **greater of**: (i) **7.5% of payroll**, or (ii) the employer’s **inflation‑adjusted** prior‑year spending on employee health benefits (premiums, HRA/HSA contributions, equivalently valued self‑insurance), net of employee contributions. Credits avoid double‑payment against employer UHAA payroll liability.  
   (B) **ADHC (workforce displacement).** For any **Covered Workforce Displacement Event**—defined as layoffs or position eliminations **caused in material part** by **AI, automation, robotics, outsourcing, or offshoring**—the employer shall continue to remit the **employer‑portion of UHAA payroll contribution and Employer MOE** for each displaced worker for **5 years** after separation, based on the worker’s final‑year wage **indexed to Core CPI**, unless: (i) the employer certifies **insolvency or closure**; (ii) the worker attains **new coverage** via employment or self‑employment (credits apply); or (iii) the employer offers and the worker accepts **equivalent employment**. Small‑employer safe harbor may apply for employers with **<25 employees** (HHS/Treasury rule). Evasion via misclassification is prohibited and subject to penalties under Section 8.

#### (b) Exclusivity; Anti‑duplication.
Amounts redirected under this Section replace duplicative outlays for Essential Services under prior programs. No other federal agency may pay for Essential Services outside the HTF, except as authorized for VA, TRICARE, and IHS.

#### (c) Payment Updates; Core‑CPI Indexation.
1. **Reimbursement Index.** Maximum reimbursement rates for HTF‑covered services are tied to **100% of current Medicare schedules**, **indexed annually to Core CPI**.  
2. **Automatic Adjusters.** All statutory caps, thresholds, penalties, and administrative limits under this Act are indexed to **Core CPI** unless otherwise specified.

#### (d) Hospital Global Budgets; Site‑Neutral Payment.
1. **All‑Payer Global Budgets.** Beginning in plan year 2, hospitals shall be paid under **global budgets** established by HHS (or approved state rate‑setting entities). Aggregate budget growth shall not exceed **Core CPI + 0.5 percentage points** annually unless waived for population need or declared emergencies.  
2. **Site‑Neutrality & Facility Fees.** For routine outpatient services (including imaging, labs, and telehealth), the HTF shall pay **site‑neutral** rates. **Facility fees** for off‑campus or non‑hospital settings are prohibited unless HHS determines clear cost justification.  
3. **Primary‑Care & Behavioral Health Models.** HHS may implement **risk‑adjusted capitation** for primary care and behavioral health with retrospective outlier review.

#### (e) National Health Budget and Capital Budget Board.
1. **National Health Budget.** Each fiscal year, HHS shall publish a **National Health Budget** for HTF operations and capital, consistent with this Section and indexed to **Core CPI**.  
2. **Capital Budget Board (CBB).** A federal **Capital Budget Board** shall approve major capital expenditures and service‑line expansions exceeding thresholds set by rule, using **CON‑like criteria** weighted by **HPSA** status, **RUCC**, equity impact, and demonstrated community need.  
3. **Public Dashboard.** HHS shall maintain a **public capital dashboard** mapping approved and denied projects, rationales, and geographic equity metrics.  
4. **Deeming & Federal–State Role.** States may operate aligned capital review entities approved by HHS; federal standards remain controlling.  
5. **No Volume Gaming.** Capital approvals shall not be tied to volume‑based payment projections; global budgets shall be adjusted only for approved capacity and population need.

#### (f) Administrative Cap.
HTF administrative expenditures shall not exceed **7%** of total HTF outlays.

#### (g) Sustainability Modeling and Triggers.
1. HHS shall annually model five‑year revenues and outlays and **publish quarterly reserve metrics** for the HTF.  
2. If projected deficits exceed **3%** of outlays, **automatic, temporary adjustments** shall increase UHAA payroll rates by up to **0.5 percentage points** across brackets and/or raise Employer MOE by up to **0.5 percentage points of payroll**, subject to a joint resolution of disapproval.  
3. If cumulative reserves exceed **two months of outlays** for two consecutive years, the Secretary may **reduce** UHAA payroll rates or Employer MOE by up to **0.5 percentage points**, consistent with actuarial balance.

#### (h) Pharmaceutical Pricing.
1. **Generics First.** HTF prioritizes generics when clinically appropriate.  
2. **HTF‑Wide Negotiation.** HHS shall negotiate **cost‑plus** and **class‑based** prices and may use **international reference pricing** for launches.  
3. **No Coverage Gaps.** The HTF provides continuous essential drug coverage without donut holes; beneficiary OOP counts toward the **5%‑of‑AGI** cap.

#### (i) Fraud & National Health Portal.
1. **AI‑Driven Fraud Detection** with annual bias/accuracy audits; human review required for adverse actions.  
2. **National Health Portal (NHP).** The NHP provides OOP tracking, longitudinal health records, **standardized stratified reporting**, public dashboards (including access metrics), and telemedicine. Stratification shall at minimum follow **OMB race/ethnicity standards**, standardized **disability** reporting per HHS rule, and **rural/urban** classification using **USDA RUCC** categories.  
3. **HIPAA Expansions.** Interoperability mandates, patient data ownership, 24‑hour breach notices, protections for de‑identified data, and NIST‑aligned cybersecurity.

#### (k) Quality Incentive Program (QIP).
1. **Establishment.** Beginning Plan Year 2, the Secretary shall operate a **QIP** that applies to hospitals, primary care, behavioral health, and multi‑specialty groups.  
2. **Withhold/Bonus.** The HTF shall **withhold 1.5%** of applicable payments subject to QIP; entities may **earn back** the withhold and up to an additional **1.5% bonus** based on performance.  
3. **Measures.** At a minimum: avoidable readmissions; access timeliness; adherence to evidence‑based care; **PROMs**; **equity‑stratified outcomes**; behavioral‑health integration; and **preventive uptake**.  
4. **Risk Adjustment & Methodology.** HHS shall apply appropriate clinical and **social risk adjustment**; **measure specifications and methodology** (including case‑mix and SDOH factors) shall be published for notice‑and‑comment **90 days before each performance year**.  
5. **Public Reporting Cadence.** Facility and group‑level QIP results shall be posted in machine‑readable format on the NHP **by March 31** following the close of each performance year, and archived for longitudinal comparison.  
6. **Budget Neutrality.** QIP operates **within existing HTF outlays** and does not increase total payments above caps.  
7. **Shared‑Savings for Multi‑Specialty Groups.** HHS shall create an optional **Shared‑Savings Arrangement (SSA)** under which qualifying multi‑specialty groups may share in measurable savings against risk‑adjusted targets, contingent on meeting QIP quality thresholds and beneficiary protections.

#### (l) Access Standards and Corrective Actions.
1. **National Minimums.**  
   (A) **Primary care (routine):** appointment within **14 calendar days**; urgent within **48 hours**.  
   (B) **Specialty (non‑urgent):** appointment within **30 calendar days**.  
   (C) **Mental/Behavioral health (non‑urgent):** appointment within **10 business days**; crisis within **24 hours**.

2. **Monitoring & Dashboards.** HHS shall publish **quarterly, state‑stratified access dashboards** on the NHP; the **first dashboard shall go live no later than the end of Year 1** and thereafter be maintained on a quarterly cadence.  
3. **Corrective Action.** Entities failing standards for two consecutive quarters shall: (A) submit a **Corrective Action Plan**; (B) be subject to a **targeted performance at‑risk amount up to 1%** of HTF payments until remediation; and (C) where capacity is binding, receive **temporary capacity grants** (e.g., extended hours, locum tenens, telehealth pods).  
4. **Persistent Failure.** After 12 months without remediation, HHS may: (A) impose **financial penalties** up to **$100,000 per instance**; (B) **reallocate GME slots** and targeted workforce incentives to shortage areas; and (C) authorize **patient travel vouchers** for necessary out‑of‑area care at HTF expense.

### SECTION 10. PREEMPTION, COORDINATION, AND CONFORMING AMENDMENTS

#### (a) Federal Preemption.
This Act preempts state laws that conflict with HTF operations under the Supremacy Clause (Article VI), including state insurance mandates, provider regulations, or benefit standards that duplicate or hinder federal uniformity in Essential Services. **State restrictions that impede access to the essential reproductive and sexual health services referenced in Section 3(2) are preempted as applied to HTF‑covered services.** State HSA rules remain where not conflicting.

#### (b) HTF Primary Payer; Third‑Party Recoveries.
The HTF is the **primary payer** for medical expenses related to injuries or illnesses covered by other insurance, including **WC, auto/PIP, liability, and no‑fault**. The HTF shall have **subrogation and reimbursement rights** to recover the reasonable value of services from third parties or their insurers; beneficiaries shall cooperate with recovery consistent with due process protections.

#### (c) Federal Programs (FEHB/CHIP/Exchanges) Conforming.
1. **FEHB Alignment.** FEHB medical coverage for Essential Services shall transition to the HTF by **the start of Year 3**; FEHB may continue to offer **supplemental** benefits consistent with Section 4(b).  
2. **CHIP Coordination.** CHIP medical benefits for Essential Services transition to the HTF by **the start of Year 3**; federal and state CHIP funding streams become part of Medicaid MOE to HTF.  
3. **ACA Exchanges Sunset.** Qualified Health Plans offering Essential Services on exchanges shall sunset for plan years **beginning Year 3**; exchanges may continue as **supplemental marketplaces**.

#### (d) Workers’ Compensation Coordination.
States shall coordinate WC medical benefits with the HTF. WC carriers shall **reimburse** the HTF for medical expenditures paid on compensable WC claims; disputes are resolved via federal standards with deference to state determinations of compensability.

#### (e) ERISA Conforming; No Duplicative Benefits.
1. **No Duplicative Essential Benefits.** Employee benefit plans governed by ERISA may **not** offer coverage duplicative of **Essential Services** covered by the HTF. Plans may offer **supplemental** benefits as defined in Section 4(b).  
2. **ERISA Sunset and Savings.** To the extent ERISA previously preempted state regulation of employer health benefits, such preemption is **sunset** with respect to Essential Services; existing fiduciary and reporting obligations remain as to supplemental benefits.  
3. **Multiemployer Plans.** Multiemployer funds shall transition Essential Services to the HTF and may continue as supplemental plans.

---

### SECTION 11. CONSTITUTIONAL BASIS AND SAFEGUARDS

#### (a) Constitutional Basis.
This Act is enacted under the Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8), as HTF regulates interstate economic activity in healthcare, a national market with multi‑state delivery and cross‑border impacts. Mechanisms such as MAC and injunctions are administrative procedures subject to judicial review, not delegations of legislative power.

#### (b) Proposed Constitutional Amendment.
“The funds of the Healthcare Trust Fund and Social Security Trust Fund shall be inviolate and used solely for their designated purposes. No law shall divert or borrow from these funds without ratification by three‑fourths of the states.”
