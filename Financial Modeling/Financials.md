# UHAA Financials — One Page (Aligned to Core‑CPI & Four‑Pillar Financing)

> **Goal:** Show how UHAA pays for itself and *bends the cost curve* vs. the current for‑profit insurance model, while investing in wellness and primary care (akin to France’s SHI approach).

## 2026 Snapshot (billions)
|  | **UHAA (Reformed)** | Notes |
|---|---:|---|
| **HTF Outlays (essential services)** | **$5,089** | Site‑neutral payments, global hospital budgets, expanded drug negotiation already applied |
| **Inflows (central case, employee 7%)** | **$5,783** | UHAA payroll (doubled employer + 7% employee), Medicare HI+Parts B/D, Medicaid MOE, Employer MOE, co‑pays |
| **Annual Balance** | **+$693** | Flows exceed outlays → builds reserves / room for rate relief |
| **Indexation** | **Core CPI** | Payment caps and thresholds indexed to core CPI; hospital budgets capped at **Core CPI + 0.5pp** |

## How UHAA Saves vs. For‑Profit Status Quo (Illustrative Annual Impacts)
| Lever | Mechanism | Conservative Impact |
|---|---|---:|
| **Administrative simplification** | Single payer for essentials reduces duplicative claims, network + prior‑auth overhead | **~$150B** |
| **Eliminate insurer net income on essentials** | Remove profit margin on essential services | **~$30B** |
| **Drug pricing (expanded negotiation)** | Cost‑plus / class‑based + reference pricing beyond IRA scope | **~$40B** |
| **Site‑neutral payments & facility‑fee limits** | Pay same rate in hospital/outpatient settings for like services; curb facility add‑ons | **~$60B** |
| **All‑payer global hospital budgets** | Hard cap on aggregate hospital revenue growth (Core CPI + 0.5pp) | **~$90B** |
| **TOTAL, order‑of‑magnitude** |  | **~$370B** |

> These savings come **on top** of better purchasing power, simpler billing, and reduced churn—areas that keep U.S. costs high under the current insurer‑centric model. Forward growth at **Core CPI + 0.5pp** on hospital budgets **bends the curve** relative to status‑quo trend growth.

## Wellness & Primary Care Focus (Why Total Costs Fall Over Time)
- **Universal, first‑dollar preventive care** and **mental‑health parity** reduce avoidable ER and inpatient utilization over time.  
- **Care coordination** and **telehealth** improve adherence and early intervention (mirrors features of France’s SHI + complementary coverage).  
- **Chronic care frameworks** and **drug affordability** increase medication adherence → fewer complications and readmissions.

> France’s model succeeds on **low admin load**, **national fee schedules**, and **broad, predictable coverage**; UHAA parallels these design choices via global budgets, site‑neutral pricing, and negotiated medicines.

## Financing (Four Pillars) — 100% Aligned to Bill Text
1) **UHAA Payroll**: employer **doubled** share; employee **5%–9.5%** band (≤105% FPL → 0%).  
2) **Medicare Realignment**: **HI payroll** + **Parts B/D general revenues** → HTF.  
3) **Medicaid MOE**: federal + state effort redirected to HTF (indexed to core CPI, enrollment‑adjusted).  
4) **Employer MOE**: **≥7.5% of payroll** or prior‑year employer health spend (inflation‑adjusted).

**Result:** 2026 inflows exceed outlays by **~$693B**, with multi‑year surpluses projected under core‑CPI caps.

## What Changed vs. the Prior Financials Note
- The earlier note focused on a **progressive payroll schedule** alone; UHAA now uses a **four‑pillar** financing framework and **core‑CPI** indexation across payments and caps to ensure sustainability.
