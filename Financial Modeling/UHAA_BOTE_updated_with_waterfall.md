**Notes:**
- Core CPI indexation applies to payment growth caps and automatic adjusters for years beyond 2026.
- Trust-fund assets (Medicare HI) are a one-time balance-sheet infusion and not included here as annual flow.
- Reform savings reflect: site-neutral payments (~$60B/yr), all-payer global hospital budgets (~$90B/yr), expanded drug negotiation (~$40B/yr).
