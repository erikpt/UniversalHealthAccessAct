### Notes & Accounting Conventions
- **Receipts included** for budget view: UHAA payroll (employee + employer), Employer MOE, Medicare HI payroll, and program co-pays (offsetting receipts).
- **Redirected Medicare Parts B/D general revenues** and **Medicaid MOE** are treated as **outlay-side financing** (not new receipts).
- **Baseline outlays** include Medicare, Medicaid, and ACA marketplace subsidies; VA/TRICARE/IHS remain outside UHAA in both cases.
- **Growth rules:** Outlays capped at **core CPI + 0.5pp (2.9%)**; payroll-linked revenue grows **4.5%**; co-pays **2%**; baseline federal health outlays **5%** nominal.
- These are **static**, not dynamic (no macro feedbacks). Classification could vary under formal scoring; this is a staff working estimate with conservative growth on redirected flows.
