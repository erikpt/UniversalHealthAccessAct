# UHAA Multi‑Year Projection (2026–2033) — Core CPI Indexation
**Base case growth assumptions:** Outlays capped at **core CPI + 0.5 pp** (~2.9%/yr). Payroll base grows **4.5%/yr**. Medicare B/D and Medicaid MOE grow with the outlay cap (2.9%). Co‑pays grow 2.0%/yr.
Figures in **billions**. 2026 base reflects the reformed package (site‑neutral + global budgets + expanded drug negotiation) and the microsim co‑pays.
