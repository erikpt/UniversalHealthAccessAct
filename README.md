# UniversalHealthAccessAct
Let's attempt to use the open-source ethos, methods and tools to write model legislation which creates a hybrid single payer health care system for the United States of America.

Read the current text of the bill [here](https://github.com/erikpt/UniversalHealthAccessAct/blob/main/Bill_Text.md)

I'm looking for participation by anyone interested in improving health care in this country. I'm an IT pro, not a lawyer or a politician, but I think collectively we can make something great.

Please make comments, and suggestions by opening an [Issue](https://github.com/erikpt/UniversalHealthAccessAct/issues) or if you'd like to edit the bill text directly submit a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
