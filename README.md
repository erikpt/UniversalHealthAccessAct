# UniversalHealthAccessAct
We’re building this project in the open to craft people-centered legislation for a hybrid single-payer health care system in the United States. By combining policy expertise, real-world experience, and collaborative problem solving, we can design an approach that protects essential care for everyone while welcoming supplemental innovation.

Our mission is to convene patients, clinicians, researchers, technologists, advocates, and public servants to shape a framework that is inclusive, sustainable, and ready for legislative consideration. Whether you bring personal stories, data-driven insights, or drafting skills, your contribution helps refine the Universal Healthcare Access Act.

Explore the current working draft of the bill [here](https://github.com/erikpt/UniversalHealthAccessAct/blob/main/Bill_Text.md), then share feedback, propose amendments, or suggest new ideas that advance the goal of equitable health care access.

# Executive Summary

The Universal Healthcare Access Act of 2026 (UHAA) establishes a hybrid single-payer model in which the **Healthcare Trust Fund (HTF)** becomes the primary payer for **essential services** while allowing **supplemental private insurance** and continued use of **HSAs** for non-essential care. Eligibility extends to citizens, legal residents, and visitors for essential services. Cost-sharing is income-based with a strict **5% of AGI** annual cap, and preventive services remain **$0** at point of care. Funding derives from progressive payroll contributions with no income cap and strict **anti-raiding** safeguards, including a proposed constitutional amendment.

Administration rests with **HHS**, with strong guardrails against unilateral executive changes and a **Medical Advisory Committee (MAC)** that updates covered services biannually. Powerful anti-fraud provisions, a **National Health Portal** with expanded HIPAA protections, price transparency mandates, and a **Healthcare Innovation Fund** ensure sustainability and modernization. The Act phases in over five years, sunsets ERISA for health benefits, realigns Medicaid and ACA funds to the HTF, and coordinates state transitions via regional offices and waivers. GAO and CBO conduct ongoing reviews; corrective mechanisms ensure administrative overhead ≤ **7%** and timely provider payment.

**What changes day one:** universal eligibility for essential services, launch of HTF setup, MAC selection, fraud-tech and portal buildout, and guardrails preventing executive disruption. **By Year 5:** full phase-out of private coverage for essential services, parity for mental health and vision, stable provider payments, and interoperable digital records nationwide.

* **Affordability**: Income-based co-pays with 5% AGI annual OOP cap; HSAs preserved for extras; hardship waivers via IRS-verified AGI.
* **Providers**: Medicare-level base rates indexed to CPI-M; +10% rural bonus; simplified billing; loan forgiveness and training expansion.
* **Pharmacy**: Generics prioritized; national **cost-plus (+15%)** negotiation; no donut holes or phase gaps; drug OOP counted toward 5% AGI cap.
* **States**: Regional coordination, optional waivers, and Medicaid/ACA fund realignment; state portals interoperable with national standards.
* **Economy**: Consolidation reduces administrative waste; portability improves labor mobility; small-business formation facilitated by decoupling insurance from employment.
