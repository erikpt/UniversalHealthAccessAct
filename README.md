Let's attempt to use the open-source ethos, methods and tools to write model legislation which creates a hybrid single payer health care system for the United States of America.

I'm looking for participation by anyone interested in improving health care in this country. I'm an IT pro, not a lawyer or a politician, but I think collectively we can make something great.

# Executive Summary

The Universal Healthcare Access Act of 2026 (UHAA) establishes a hybrid single-payer model in which the **Healthcare Trust Fund (HTF)** becomes the primary payer for **essential services** while allowing **supplemental private insurance** and continued use of **HSAs** for non-essential care. Eligibility extends to citizens, legal residents, and visitors for essential services. Cost-sharing is income-based with a strict **5% of AGI** annual cap, and preventive services remain **$0** at point of care. Funding derives from progressive payroll contributions with no income cap and strict **anti-raiding** safeguards, including a proposed constitutional amendment.

Administration rests with **HHS**, with strong guardrails against unilateral executive changes and a **Medical Advisory Committee (MAC)** that updates covered services biannually. Powerful anti-fraud provisions, a **National Health Portal** with expanded HIPAA protections, price transparency mandates, and a **Healthcare Innovation Fund** ensure sustainability and modernization. The Act phases in over five years, sunsets ERISA for health benefits, realigns Medicaid and ACA funds to the HTF, and coordinates state transitions via regional offices and waivers. GAO and CBO conduct ongoing reviews; corrective mechanisms ensure administrative overhead ≤ **7%** and timely provider payment.

**What changes day one:** universal eligibility for essential services, launch of HTF setup, MAC selection, fraud-tech and portal buildout, and guardrails preventing executive disruption. **By Year 5:** full phase-out of private coverage for essential services, parity for mental health and vision, stable provider payments, and interoperable digital records nationwide.
