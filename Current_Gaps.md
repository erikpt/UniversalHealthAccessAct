### Current Gaps in our Legislation

The current bill draft is comprehensive but could benefit from addressing several common gaps in universal healthcare proposals, based on analyses of similar plans like Medicare for All. Here's a prioritized list of potential omissions or areas for expansion:

1. **Value-Based Payment Reforms**: The bill ties reimbursements to Medicare schedules (Section 5(c)(1)), which critics note encourage volume over value and undervalue cognitive/primary care. Add incentives for quality outcomes (e.g., bonuses for preventive metrics) or shift to bundled payments.

2. **Preventive and Public Health Focus**: While exemptions cover some preventive care (Section 4(d)(7)), there's no dedicated funding or programs for population health (e.g., environmental interventions, disparities reduction). Allocate 5-10% of HTF for community health initiatives.

3. **Wait Times and Access Guarantees**: No mechanisms to address potential delays. Add targets (e.g., <30 days non-emergent) with penalties for providers exceeding them, or expand rural bonuses.

4. **Underinsurance Protections**: Co-pays and OOP caps help, but no explicit handling of underinsurance for non-essentials or high-need groups. Clarify supplemental insurance mandates or subsidies.

5. **Detailed Transition for Existing Programs**: Section 7(a)(2) mentions integrating Medicare/Medicaid, but lacks specifics on avoiding disruptions. Add phased enrollment, beneficiary notifications, and continuity guarantees.

6. **Equity for Vulnerable Populations**: Addresses rural areas but not urban disparities, immigrants (beyond visitors), or social determinants. Include targeted outreach or adjustments for low-SES groups.

7. **Public Input Beyond MAC**: MAC has a comment period (Section 6(c)(3)), but no broader stakeholder engagement. Require annual town halls or advisory boards with patients/consumers.

8. **Long-Term Care**: Not covered, a frequent gap. Phase in basic coverage or link to existing programs.

9. **Cost Scoring and Independent Review**: Sustainability modeling exists (Section 5(d)), but mandate initial CBO scoring pre-enactment.

10. **Abortion/ Reproductive Services**: Not specified; clarify inclusion under essentials to avoid ambiguity.

Prioritize based on your goalsâ€”e.g., add to Section 6(c) for equity reviews or Section 4 for access guarantees.
