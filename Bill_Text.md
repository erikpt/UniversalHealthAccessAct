# Revised Universal Healthcare Access Act of 2026 (UHAA) — Updated Draft (Core‑CPI & Financing Aligned)

## A Bill to Establish a Hybrid Single-Payer Healthcare System in the United States

**Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,**

---

### SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE
This Act may be cited as the **“Universal Healthcare Access Act of 2026” (UHAA).**

---

### SECTION 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE

#### (a) Findings
Congress finds the following:

1. The current U.S. healthcare system is fragmented, costly, and inefficient, with administrative overhead and insurer profits exceeding $30 billion annually in denied care and net income for major insurers as of 2024.
2. All Americans deserve access to essential healthcare services without financial ruin, regardless of employment, income, or pre‑existing conditions.
3. Single‑payer systems in peer nations demonstrate that universal coverage financed through broad‑based contributions, paired with cost controls, can achieve efficiency and equity.
4. Transitioning to universal coverage in the United States requires a hybrid approach that preserves existing provider networks while simplifying administration and ensuring budget discipline.
5. Oversight should be limited to funding and compliance, not clinical decision‑making by medical professionals.
6. Protecting the system’s integrity requires safeguards against political interference, including protection for dedicated healthcare funds.
7. Income‑based co‑pays may promote responsible utilization while maintaining affordability and equity.
8. Integration of mental health, vision, and telemedicine services will strengthen outcomes, particularly for rural communities.
9. ERISA‑based employer self‑insurance fragments standards; a unified national approach enhances interstate commerce and consistency.
10. Healthcare is an instrument of interstate commerce, requiring national uniformity and regulatory authority under the Commerce Clause.

#### (b) Purpose
The purpose of this Act is to:
1. Establish a national **Healthcare Trust Fund (HTF)** as the single payer for **essential services**.
2. Preserve a **hybrid** design allowing supplemental private insurance and continued use of **Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)** for non‑essential services.
3. Align financing with scope by **redirecting existing federal and employer health dollars** into the HTF, while enforcing **cost controls** and **core‑CPI‑linked** growth limits.
4. Eliminate profit‑driven denials of essential care and simplify administration.
5. Promote equity through phased integration, anti‑fraud capability, and uniform national standards.

---

### SECTION 3. DEFINITIONS
1. **Healthcare Trust Fund (HTF).** A dedicated federal fund administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that pays qualified providers for essential services.
2. **Essential Services.** Medical services, procedures, and pharmaceuticals initially based on those covered under Medicare as of 2026, subject to biennial review by the Medical Advisory Committee (MAC), including phased mental health and vision services.
3. **Qualified Provider.** Any licensed healthcare professional or facility in the United States participating in the HTF, including telemedicine providers.
4. **Non‑Resident.** An individual visiting the United States without U.S. citizenship or permanent residency.
5. **Adjusted Gross Income (AGI).** As reported on the most recent federal tax return, with annual verification via IRS data‑sharing.
6. **Rural Area.** Designated zip codes under USDA Rural‑Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC 4‑9) or successor HHS metric.
7. **Health Savings Account (HSA).** Tax‑advantaged accounts under Section 223 of the Internal Revenue Code for qualified medical expenses.
8. **Core CPI.** The **Core Consumer Price Index** (all items less food and energy) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics; used for payment updates, caps, and automatic fiscal adjusters under this Act.
9. **Employer Maintenance of Effort (Employer MOE).** A mandatory employer contribution to the HTF that replaces prior employer premium spending, calculated as a percentage of payroll or prior‑year employer health spend, as provided in Section 5.
10. **Medicaid Maintenance of Effort (Medicaid MOE).** Federal and state contributions to HTF that maintain fiscal effort equivalent to pre‑Act Medicaid spending, as provided in Section 5.

---

### SECTION 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF UNIVERSAL COVERAGE

#### (a) Eligibility.
Every U.S. citizen, lawful resident, and visitor shall be eligible for **essential services** under the HTF.

#### (b) Hybrid System.
1. The HTF is the primary payer for essential services, replacing private insurance for those services.
2. Private insurers may offer **supplemental** coverage for non‑essential services and amenities; they may not deny or delay HTF‑covered services.
3. Employers and individuals transition over five years; low‑income participants receive refundable tax credits for supplemental coverage where appropriate.
4. VA, TRICARE, and Indian Health Service remain operational; beneficiaries may opt to integrate with HTF per agency agreements.
5. **Preservation of HSAs.** HSAs may be used for non‑essential services, co‑pays, or other qualified expenses; nothing in this Act restricts new or existing HSAs.

#### (c) Non‑Resident Billing.
Non‑residents shall be billed post‑service at HHS‑established fair market rates based on Medicare schedules **plus 20%** administrative fee; international collection agreements may be used.

#### (d) Patient Cost‑Sharing (Co‑Pays).
1. **Low‑Income (≤ $75,000 AGI individual / $150,000 household).** $0 for essential services except: ER $50; ambulance $50; hospital day $25 (max $500/yr for this category); Rx $10 or price if lower; specialist $25; imaging $25; mental health $25; vision visit $25 ($50 for basic lenses/bifocals/trifocals).  
2. **Mid‑Income ($75,001–$200,000).** ER $100; ambulance $100; hospital day $50 (max $500/yr); primary care $20; Rx $20 or price if lower; specialist $50; imaging $50; labs $10 per order; mental health $50; vision $25 ($100 for basic lenses/bifocals/trifocals).  
3. **High‑Income (>$200,000).** Co‑pays in paragraph (2) are **doubled**.  
4. **Very‑High‑Income (>$500,000).** Co‑pays in paragraph (2) are **tripled**.  
5. **Annual OOP Cap.** Total co‑pays are capped at **5% of AGI** annually, tracked via the National Health Portal; excess automatically refunded.  
6. **Administration and Hardship.** Providers collect co‑pays; HHS may waive for hardship. HSAs may pay co‑pays.  
7. **Exemptions.** Preventive care, vaccinations, pediatric services, and telemedicine overhead adjustments are exempt; telemedicine co‑pays mirror in‑person.  
8. **Appeals.** Patients may appeal co‑pay determinations to the HHS Ombuds Office within 30 days; decisions are binding and judicially reviewable.

#### (e) Telemedicine Parity.
Telemedicine services are reimbursed at **80%** of equivalent in‑person rates; platforms must meet federal cybersecurity standards.

---

### SECTION 5. FINANCING AND COST CONTROL (REVISED)

#### (a) Four‑Pillar Financing.
To align revenue with scope and ensure fiscal balance, the HTF is financed through the following consolidated pillars:

1. **UHAA Payroll Contribution.**  
   (A) **Employer portion (doubled).** Employer marginal contribution rates are **doubled** relative to the prior baseline, resulting in:  
   • Up to $200,000 AGI: **9.33%** employer;  
   • $200,001–$500,000: **16%** employer;  
   • $500,001–$1,000,000: **20%** employer;  
   • Over $1,000,000: **24%** employer.  
   (B) **Employee portion.** Employee marginal contribution rates are **capped at 9.5%** and **may not fall below 5%** for individuals and households **at or above 105% of the federal poverty line (FPL)**; individuals and households **below 105% FPL** owe **0%** employee contribution.  
   (C) Contributions apply to all wages and compensation with no upper cap. The Secretary shall issue regulations to prevent misclassification and avoidance.

2. **Medicare Realignment.**  
   (A) **Medicare Hospital Insurance (HI) payroll tax** and the **existing HI Trust Fund balance** are consolidated into the HTF.  
   (B) **Medicare Parts B and D** general revenue contributions are **redirected** to the HTF, with beneficiary protections maintained.

3. **Medicaid Maintenance of Effort (Medicaid MOE).** Federal and state Medicaid funding streams are **redirected** to the HTF on a maintenance‑of‑effort basis equal to pre‑Act levels, with state contributions indexed to **core CPI** and adjusted for enrollment.

4. **Employer Maintenance of Effort (Employer MOE).** Employers shall remit to the HTF the **greater of**:  
   (A) **7.5% of payroll**, or  
   (B) The employer’s **inflation‑adjusted** prior‑year spending on employee health benefits (premiums, HRA/HSA contributions, and equivalent), net of employee contributions.  
   Credits are available to avoid double‑payment against the employer portion of the UHAA payroll contribution. The Secretary shall prevent evasion via workforce reclassification.

#### (b) Exclusivity; Anti‑duplication.
Amounts redirected under this Section replace duplicative outlays for essential services under prior programs. No other federal agency may pay for essential services outside the HTF, except as authorized for VA, TRICARE, and IHS.

#### (c) Payment Updates; Core‑CPI Indexation.
1. **Reimbursement Index.** Maximum reimbursement rates for HTF‑covered services are tied to **100% of current Medicare schedules**, **indexed annually to core CPI**.  
2. **Automatic Adjusters.** All statutory caps, thresholds, penalties, and administrative limits under this Act are indexed to **core CPI** unless otherwise specified.

#### (d) Hospital Global Budgets; Site‑Neutral Payment.
1. **All‑Payer Global Budgets.** Beginning in plan year 2, hospitals shall be paid under **global budgets** established by HHS (or approved state rate‑setting entities). Aggregate budget growth shall not exceed **core CPI + 0.5 percentage points** annually unless waived for population need or declared emergencies.  
2. **Site‑Neutrality & Facility Fees.** For routine outpatient services (including imaging, labs, and telehealth), the HTF shall pay **site‑neutral** rates. **Facility fees** for off‑campus or non‑hospital settings are prohibited unless HHS determines clear cost justification.  
3. **Primary‑Care & Behavioral Health Models.** HHS may implement **risk‑adjusted capitation** for primary care and behavioral health with retrospective outlier review.

#### (e) Administrative Cap.
HTF administrative expenditures shall not exceed **7%** of total HTF outlays.

#### (f) Sustainability Modeling and Triggers.
1. HHS shall annually model five‑year revenues and outlays.  
2. If projected deficits exceed **3%** of outlays, **automatic, temporary adjustments** shall increase UHAA payroll rates by up to **0.5 percentage points** across brackets and/or raise Employer MOE by up to **0.5 percentage points of payroll**, subject to a joint resolution of disapproval.  
3. If cumulative reserves exceed **two months of outlays** for two consecutive years, the Secretary may **reduce** UHAA payroll rates or Employer MOE by up to **0.5 percentage points**, consistent with actuarial balance.

### SECTION 6. ADMINISTRATION AND OVERSIGHT

#### (a) Role of HHS.
1. HHS shall administer payments, verify services, combat fraud using AI‑assisted detection with human oversight, and manage IRS data integration for income verification; HHS may not direct clinical decisions.  
2. **Prohibition on Unilateral Changes.** The Secretary may not unilaterally change covered benefits, eligibility, reimbursement rates, or co‑pays. Changes require MAC approval and a joint resolution of Congress within 90 days. Civil penalties up to $1,000,000 per violation apply.  
3. **Prevention of Executive Interference.** No executive action may alter this Act absent statute; unlawful actions are null and void and subject to expedited judicial review under the APA.  
4. **Automatic Injunction Mechanism.** If an executive official attempts to impair the HTF, a petition by 10 or more states shall trigger an **automatic preliminary injunction** pending expedited review by the Supreme Court.

#### (b) Clinical Decision‑Making and Patient Choice.
1. Medical necessity, triage, and scheduling are determined by qualified providers.  
2. Patients may seek care from any qualified provider nationwide without prior authorization or network restrictions.  
3. **Enforcement of Patient Choice.** Unauthorized restrictions are subject to civil penalties up to $100,000 per violation, with whistleblower protections and GAO oversight.

#### (c) Medical Advisory Committee (MAC).
1. **Composition.** Two physicians per state (100 total), selected by lottery; two‑year non‑renewable terms.  
2. **Duties.** Biennial review of essential services and co‑pay applicability; recommendations require a two‑thirds vote and are binding unless overridden by Congress.

#### (d) Pharmaceutical Pricing.
1. **Generics First.** HTF prioritizes generics when clinically appropriate.  
2. **HTF‑Wide Negotiation.** HHS shall negotiate **cost‑plus** and **class‑based** prices and may use **international reference pricing** for launches.  
3. **No Coverage Gaps.** The HTF provides continuous essential drug coverage without donut holes; beneficiary OOP counts toward the 5%‑of‑AGI cap.

#### (e) Fraud & National Health Portal.
1. **AI‑Driven Fraud Detection** with annual bias/accuracy audits; human review required for adverse actions.  
2. **National Health Portal** provides OOP tracking, longitudinal health records, and telemedicine.  
3. **HIPAA Expansions.** Interoperability mandates, patient data ownership, 24‑hour breach notices, protections for de‑identified data, and NIST‑aligned cybersecurity.

#### (f) Provider Participation.
1. **Incentives.** Up to **$100,000** student‑loan forgiveness for 5‑year service; enhanced payments in underserved areas.  
2. **Participation Lever.** All Medicare‑certified providers must join HTF or forfeit federal healthcare program eligibility; facilities receiving federal funds pre‑Act must join.

#### (g) Immigration for Providers.
Expanded visas and expedited naturalization for foreign‑trained clinicians who obtain U.S. certification and commit to five years of service, with rural prioritization.

#### (h) Protection Against Executive Orders.
As stated above, any attempt to circumvent this Act is subject to immediate judicial challenge with a presumption of irreparable harm and expedited relief.

### SECTION 7. TRANSITION AND IMPLEMENTATION

#### (a) Timeline.
1. **Year 1.** Establish HTF, MAC lottery, data pipelines (IRS, CMS, states), National Health Portal, and payment operations; publish initial **site‑neutral** schedule; pilot hospital global budgets.  
2. **Year 2.** Consolidate **Medicare HI** and **Parts B/D** flows into HTF; launch national **global budgets** for hospitals with **core‑CPI+0.5** growth caps; begin Employer MOE at **5%** of payroll.  
3. **Years 3–4.** Raise Employer MOE to **7.5%**; complete Medicaid MOE transition for all states; phase in mental health parity and vision coverage.  
4. **Years 2–5.** Phase‑out private insurance for essential services; fully implement site‑neutral payments and facility‑fee restrictions.

#### (b) Impact on Stakeholders.
1. Insurers pivot to supplemental markets and administrative services.  
2. Providers gain stable cash flow with simpler billing and defined growth paths.  
3. Patients gain access, free choice of qualified providers, and income‑scaled affordability; HSAs remain for extras.

#### (c) Reporting.
HHS shall report annually on coverage, wait times (<30 days for non‑urgent care), equity metrics, patient satisfaction, and financial balance versus baselines.

---

### SECTION 8. ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES

#### (a) Fraud Definitions and Penalties.
1. **Fraud** includes intentional deception or omission in claims, service provision, or co‑pay collection that causes improper HTF payments.  
2. **Provider Fraud.** Fines up to **$2.5M** and ≥180 days imprisonment for the first occurrence; up to **$5M** and ≥1 year imprisonment plus license revocation for the second; enhanced penalties thereafter.  
3. **Patient Fraud.** Fines up to **$250k** (first), **$500k** and ≥90 days (second), **$1M** and ≥1 year (subsequent).  
4. **Co‑Pay Evasion.** Intentional evasion is fraud; non‑fraudulent missed co‑pays by citizens, lawful residents, or ITIN filers may be collected by the IRS through normal processes.

#### (b) Audits and Oversight.
GAO shall perform annual independent audits of HTF operations, payment accuracy, AI efficacy, and MAC decisions; HHS must implement recommendations within 180 days or explain to Congress.

#### (c) Additional Safeguards.
OIG enforces with a five‑year statute of limitations; negligent violations may incur civil penalties up to **$500k** per incident.

---

### SECTION 9. SEVERABILITY
If any provision is held invalid, the remainder shall remain in effect. Co‑pay provisions are severable; if invalidated, default to **$0** co‑pays for all until Congress acts.

---

### SECTION 10. PREEMPTION AND CONSTITUTIONAL SAFEGUARDS

#### (a) Preemption.
This Act preempts state laws that conflict with HTF operations, including duplicative mandates or restrictions that hinder uniform national standards for essential services. State HSA rules remain where not conflicting.

#### (b) Constitutional Basis.
This Act is enacted under the Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8), as HTF regulates interstate economic activity in healthcare, a national market with multi‑state delivery and cross‑border impacts. Mechanisms such as MAC and injunctions are administrative procedures subject to judicial review, not delegations of legislative power.

#### (c) Proposed Constitutional Amendment.
“The funds of the Healthcare Trust Fund and Social Security Trust Fund shall be inviolate and used solely for their designated purposes. No law shall divert or borrow from these funds without ratification by three‑fourths of the states.”

---
