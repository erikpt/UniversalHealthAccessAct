# Revised Universal Healthcare Access Act of 2026

## A Bill to Establish a Hybrid Single-Payer Healthcare System in the United States

**Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled,**

### SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE
This Act may be cited as the "Universal Healthcare Access Act of 2026" (UHAA).

### SECTION 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE
(a) **Findings.** Congress finds the following:
   1. The current U.S. healthcare system is fragmented, costly, and inefficient, with administrative overhead and profits from private insurers exceeding $30 billion annually in denied care and net income for major insurers as of 2024.
   2. All Americans deserve access to essential healthcare services without financial ruin, regardless of employment, income, or pre-existing conditions.
   3. Single-payer systems in countries like Canada and France provide universal coverage funded through progressive taxation, with mechanisms to bill non-residents at fair rates post-service.
   4. Transitioning to universal coverage requires a hybrid approach to accommodate advanced technology, existing infrastructure, and provider networks.
   5. Government oversight must be limited to administration and funding, preserving clinical decisions for medical professionals.
   6. Protecting the system's integrity requires safeguards against political interference, including constitutional protections for funding.
   7. Modest co-pays for higher-income individuals can encourage responsible utilization while maintaining affordability and equity.
   8. Integration of mental health, vision, and telemedicine services, along with incentives for rural care and foreign-trained providers, will enhance access and sustainability.
   9. Employer self-insurance under ERISA fragments care standards and undermines national uniformity; sunsetting ERISA for health benefits promotes interstate commerce in healthcare services.
   10. This Act regulates interstate commerce, as patients may receive care across state lines without restrictions, facilitating a national market for healthcare delivery.

(b) **Purpose.** The purpose of this Act is to:
   1. Establish a national Healthcare Trust Fund (HTF) as a single-payer mechanism for core services, funded by dedicated contributions.
   2. Create a hybrid system allowing supplemental private insurance for non-essential services.
   3. Ensure cost controls, transparency, depoliticized decision-making on covered services, income-based cost-sharing, and robust data security.
   4. Eliminate profit-driven denials of care by private insurers for essential services.
   5. Promote equity through phased expansions, fraud detection, and uniform standards via ERISA sunset.

### SECTION 3. DEFINITIONS
1. **Healthcare Trust Fund (HTF).** A dedicated federal fund administered by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for paying qualified healthcare providers.
2. **Essential Services.** Medical services, procedures, and pharmaceuticals initially based on those covered under Medicare as of 2026, subject to biennial review, including phased mental health and vision services.
3. **Qualified Provider.** Any licensed healthcare professional or facility in the United States participating in the HTF, including telemedicine providers.
4. **Non-Resident.** An individual visiting the United States without U.S. citizenship or permanent residency.
5. **Adjusted Gross Income (AGI).** As reported on the most recent federal tax return, with annual verification via IRS data-sharing.
6. **Rural Area.** Designated zip codes under the USDA Rural-Urban Continuum Codes (RUCC 4-9) or equivalent HHS metric.

### SECTION 4. ESTABLISHMENT OF UNIVERSAL COVERAGE
(a) **Eligibility.** Every U.S. citizen, legal resident, and visitor shall be eligible for essential services under the HTF.
(b) **Hybrid System.**
   1. The HTF shall serve as the primary payer for essential services, replacing private insurance for these services.
   2. Private insurers may offer supplemental coverage for non-essential services (e.g., elective cosmetic procedures) not covered by the HTF, but may not duplicate or deny HTF-covered services.
   3. Employers and individuals may transition from existing plans over a 5-year phase-in period, with tax credits for low-income participants.
   4. Existing federal programs (VA, TRICARE, and Indian Health Service) remain unchanged and operate in parallel, with optional integration for beneficiaries.

(c) **Non-Resident Billing.** Non-residents receiving services shall be billed post-service at fair market rates established by HHS, based on Medicare schedules plus a 20% administrative fee (inclusive of any applicable co-pays). Collection shall be pursued through international agreements where applicable.

(d) **Patient Cost-Sharing (Co-Pays).**
   1. **No Co-Pays for Low-Income Individuals.** Individuals with AGI of $75,000 or less (or $150,000 for households) pay $0 for all essential services with the following exceptions:
      - Emergency Care: $50 per incident.
      - Ambulance: $50 per trip.
      - Hospital Stay: $25 per day, with a $500 annual out-of-pocket maximum per individual for this category.
      - Prescription Drug: $10 or actual price of drug, whichever is less, per fill.
      - Specialist Visit: $25 per visit.
      - Diagnostic Imaging: $25 per procedure.
      - Mental Health Session: $25 per session (phased in over Years 2-5).
      - Vision Visit: $25 per visit; $50 for basic lenses, bifocals, trifocals, or frames (phased in over Years 2-5).
   2. **Standard Co-Pays for Mid-Income Individuals.** For individuals with AGI over $75,000 but $200,000 or less (or household equivalent):
      - Emergency Care: $100 per incident.
      - Ambulance: $100 per trip.
      - Hospital Stay: $50 per day, with a $500 annual out-of-pocket maximum per individual for this category.
      - Primary Care Visit: $20 per visit.
      - Prescription Drug: $20 or actual price of drug, whichever is less, per fill.
      - Specialist Visit: $50 per visit.
      - Diagnostic Imaging: $50 per procedure.
      - Labs: $10 per order (multiple tests may be combined in a single order).
      - Mental Health Session: $50 per session (phased in over Years 2-5).
      - Vision Visit: $25 per visit; $100 for basic lenses, bifocals, trifocals, or frames (phased in over Years 2-5).
   3. **Co-Pays for High-Income Individuals.** For individuals with AGI over $200,000 (or household equivalent), co-pays in subsection (d)(2) are doubled.
   4. **Co-Pays for Highest-Income Individuals.** For individuals with AGI over $500,000 (or household equivalent), co-pays in subsection (d)(2) are trebled.
   5. **Annual OOP Cap.** Total out-of-pocket costs (all co-pays combined) capped at 5% of AGI annually, tracked via the National Health Portal; excesses refunded automatically.
   6. **Administration of Co-Pays.** Providers collect co-pays at point of service; uncollected amounts may be billed to patients. HHS shall waive co-pays for financial hardship (verified via AGI or application). Annual out-of-pocket tracking via the National Health Portal to enforce caps.
   7. **Exemptions.** Preventive care, vaccinations, pediatric services (under age 18), and telemedicine-specific overhead adjustments are exempt from additional fees; co-pays for telemedicine mirror in-person but reimbursements are 80% of in-person rates.
   8. **Appeals Process.** Patients may appeal co-pay applications, waivers, or billing disputes to an independent HHS Ombuds Office within 30 days; appeals for waivers or reductions must include means-testing via AGI verification or hardship affidavit. Decisions binding and reviewable in federal court.

(e) **Telemedicine Parity.** Telemedicine services reimbursed at 80% of equivalent in-person rates due to lower overhead; co-pays remain unchanged. Providers must certify secure platforms compliant with cybersecurity standards.

### SECTION 5. FUNDING MECHANISM
(a) **Contributions.** 
   1. The HTF shall be funded through a progressive payroll tax on employers and employees, scaled by income brackets: Total rate determined actuarially (initially 6% of payroll, with employers paying 2/3 and employees 1/3), plus a 5% value-added tax on luxury goods.
   2. All Americans "pay in a little" via these mechanisms, ensuring pooled resources for universal access.
   3. Projected savings from eliminating insurer profits ($30 billion annually), administrative efficiencies, and co-pay collections shall offset initial costs.

(b) **Prohibition on Raiding Funds.** 
   1. HTF funds shall be used solely for healthcare payments, administration (capped at 7% of expenditures), and fraud prevention.
   2. Congress and the President are prohibited from borrowing, reallocating, or dismantling the HTF without a supermajority vote (three-fourths of both Houses) and ratification by three-fourths of states.
   3. This section encourages a constitutional amendment (proposed in Section 10) to permanently secure the HTF and Social Security Trust Fund from diversion.

(c) **Cost Controls.**
   1. Maximum reimbursement rates for services shall be set at 100% of current Medicare schedules (net of co-pays), indexed annually to the Consumer Price Index for Medical Care (CPI-M).
   2. Providers shall be reimbursed directly by the HTF upon service verification, with co-pays deducted from patient responsibility.
   3. **Rural Incentive Bonus.** Providers receive a 10% reimbursement bonus for services where both provider practice and patient reside in designated rural zip codes as defined by USDA ERS RUCA codes and their zip code approximation.

(d) **Sustainability Modeling.**
   1. HHS shall annually model HTF sustainability using actuarial analysis, projecting revenues vs. expenditures for the next 5 years.
   2. If projected deficits exceed 3% of expenditures, automatic triggers adjust payroll tax rates upward by up to 0.5% (maintaining 2/3 employer-1/3 employee split), subject to Congressional review within 90 days.

### SECTION 6. ADMINISTRATION AND OVERSIGHT
(a) **Role of HHS.**
   1. HHS shall administer payments, verify services rendered, combat fraud via AI-driven detection systems, and manage co-pay data integration with IRS for income verification, but shall not deny care, set triage priorities, or limit doctor-patient decisions.
   2. The Secretary of HHS is "handcuffed" from unilateral changes: Any programmatic alteration requires approval by the Medical Advisory Committee (MAC) and Congress.
   3. If a Secretary attempts dismantling, an automatic injunction shall issue from the Supreme Court, triggered by a petition from 10 or more states.

(b) **Clinical Decision-Making.**
   1. Doctors and qualified providers alone shall determine medical necessity, triage, and scheduling based on patient needs and provider availability.
   2. Patients may seek care from any qualified provider nationwide without network restrictions or prior authorizations.

(c) **Medical Advisory Committee (MAC).**
   1. Composition: Two doctors per state (100 total), selected by random lottery from all licensed physicians in each state. Terms: 2 years, non-renewable, starting in odd-numbered years (opposite congressional elections).
   2. Duties: Biennial review of essential services list (including co-pay applicability and phased expansions like mental health/vision), recommending additions/removals based on evidence-based medicine, cost-effectiveness, and technological advancements. Initial list mirrors Medicare-covered services.
   3. Depoliticization: Lottery ensures randomized representation of specialties; no political appointments. Decisions require a two-thirds majority and are binding unless overridden by Congress via joint resolution.

(d) **Pharmaceutical Pricing.**
   1. Emphasis on generics: HTF reimbursements prioritize generic equivalents where available.
   2. Negotiated Pricing: HHS shall negotiate cost-plus contracts (manufacturing cost + 15% profit margin) with pharmaceutical companies for brand-name drugs. Bulk purchasing shall leverage national scale for discounts. Co-pays apply after negotiated pricing.

(e) **Fraud Detection and National Health Portal.**
   1. AI-Driven Fraud Detection: HHS shall deploy artificial intelligence systems to analyze claims patterns, flagged anomalies referred for audit; funded within admin cap. AI ethics require bias audits and human oversight.
   2. National Health Portal: A secure, centralized platform for OOP tracking, electronic health records, and telemedicine access. 
   3. **HIPAA Expansions:** The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) is amended to: (i) mandate nationwide interoperability standards for electronic health records, ensuring seamless data exchange across providers and the Portal; (ii) grant patients full ownership and portable control over their records, with mandatory opt-in consent for any sharing beyond direct care; (iii) require AI and algorithmic tools (e.g., fraud detection) to undergo annual bias and accuracy audits by independent entities; (iv) impose mandatory 24-hour breach notifications to patients and HHS, with fines scaled to harm; (v) expand protections to de-identified data used in research, requiring anonymization protocols and patient opt-out rights; (vi) enforce cybersecurity via NIST standards integration, including end-to-end encryption and regular penetration testing for all Portal-connected systems.

(f) **Provider Participation.**
   1. Incentives: Student loan forgiveness (up to $100,000) for providers committing 5 years to HTF; enhanced reimbursements in underserved areas.
   2. No federal mandate for provider opt-in, but all Medicare-certified providers must participate or lose other federal funding eligibility (tying to existing levers). Facilities receiving federal funds pre-Act must join.

(g) **Immigration for Providers.**
   1. Expanded visas (e.g., EB-2 extensions) and fast-track citizenship paths for foreign-trained doctors who obtain U.S. certification, commit to 5 years of in-person practice in the U.S., with priority for rural areas.

### SECTION 7. TRANSITION AND IMPLEMENTATION
(a) **Timeline.**
   1. Year 1: Establish HTF, MAC lottery, funding streams, co-pay infrastructure (e.g., IRS integration), AI fraud systems, and National Health Portal.
   2. Years 2-5: Phase out private insurance for essential services; integrate Medicare/Medicaid into HTF; phase in mental health (full parity by Year 4) and vision services.
   3. Recognition of Challenges: Account for technology-driven costs by allocating 10% of HTF for innovation grants to providers adopting efficient tech (e.g., telemedicine). Pilot co-pay systems and rural bonuses in Year 1.
   4. ERISA Sunset and Preemption: The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) is sunset for health benefits effective Year 1; all employer-sponsored plans for essential services are preempted and transitioned to HTF contributions. Employers must redirect equivalent funds to payroll taxes.

(b) **Impact on Stakeholders.**
   1. Insurance companies lose profits from essential services but may pivot to supplemental plans.
   2. Providers gain stable reimbursements without billing hassles, with co-pay collection streamlined via electronic systems and rural incentives.
   3. Patients benefit from no-cost or low-cost essential care, with freedom to choose providers and income-scaled affordability.

(c) **Annual Reporting and Evaluation.**
   1. HHS shall submit annual reports to Congress on outcomes: improvements in life expectancy, average wait times (target <30 days for non-emergent care), access equity metrics (e.g., rural vs. urban disparities), patient satisfaction rates, and cost savings compared to pre-Act baselines.
   2. Sunset Clauses: If goals (e.g., 90% satisfaction rates per independent surveys, deficit <3%, wait times met) are unmet for 3 consecutive years per GAO review, affected provisions (e.g., co-pays or expansions) auto-expire unless reauthorized by Congress.

### SECTION 8. ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES
(a) Fraud by providers, patients, or in co-pay evasion shall be punishable by fines up to $1 million and imprisonment.
(b) Annual audits by an independent GAO overseer, including co-pay compliance and AI efficacy.

### SECTION 9. SEVERABILITY
If any provision is held invalid, the remainder shall remain in effect. Specifically, co-pay provisions are severable; if challenged, default to $0 co-pays for all.

### SECTION 10. PREEMPTION AND CONSTITUTIONAL SAFEGUARDS
(a) **Preemption.** This Act preempts state laws conflicting with HTF operations under the Supremacy Clause (Article VI), including state insurance mandates, provider regulations, or benefit standards that duplicate or hinder federal uniformity in essential services (e.g., state-level co-pay caps or telemedicine restrictions).
(b) **Constitutional Basis.** All provisions are enacted under Congress's Commerce Clause authority (Article I, Section 8), as the HTF regulates interstate economic activity in healthcare—a national market where patients cross state lines for care, providers operate multi-state networks, and services impact commerce (consistent with precedents like Wickard v. Filburn and NFIB v. Sebelius). A bipartisan commission (5 Democrats, 5 Republicans appointed by congressional leaders) shall review implementation rules for constitutionality within 6 months of enactment; novel mechanisms (e.g., MAC lottery, automatic injunctions) are administrative procedures subject to judicial review, not delegations of legislative power.
(c) **Proposed Constitutional Amendment.** Congress proposes an amendment to the Constitution: "The funds of the Healthcare Trust Fund and Social Security Trust Fund shall be inviolate and used solely for their designated purposes. No law shall divert or borrow from these funds without ratification by three-fourths of the states."

### SECTION 11. EFFECTIVE DATE
This Act shall take effect 180 days after enactment, with funding mechanisms and co-pay rules beginning in Fiscal Year 2027. 

**End of Bill.**
