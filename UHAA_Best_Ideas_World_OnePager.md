# UHAA: The Best Ideas From Around the World
*A practical blend of proven reforms from France, Canada, Portugal — and other high‑performers — adapted for the U.S.*

## Why this approach
Instead of reinventing the wheel, UHAA borrows and adapts the most effective global tools for **access, disciplined costs, and operational simplicity**—while preserving U.S. choice of provider and our income‑based co‑pays.

## What we borrowed — and how UHAA uses it

| Global idea | Where it works | What UHAA does | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Five Principles of Coverage** (public administration, comprehensiveness, universality, portability, accessibility) | **Canada** | Adds a statutory **Guiding Principles** clause and requires **HHS/MAC** to certify rulemaking against them. | Anchors program ethos and guards against policy drift; helps defend rules in court. |
| **National Health Budget with Sector Targets (ONDAM)** | **France** | Annual **National Health Budget** with **sub‑targets** for Hospital, Ambulatory/Primary Care, LTSS, and Rx/Devices; **mid‑year corrections** allowed. | Keeps total spend inside a transparent target; lets HHS adjust early before overruns. |
| **Safeguard Clause (Rx/Device Clawback)** | **France** | If **Rx/Devices** overspend their sub‑target, HHS assesses a **proportional industry payback** (shortage‑critical items exempt). | Shares overrun risk with manufacturers; protects the Trust Fund without cutting care. |
| **No Upfront Payment + Smart Card** (tiers payant / Carte Vitale) | **France** | **Payment‑in‑Full** rule, **no advance payment** for Essential Services, and an **NHP Card** (physical/digital) for real‑time eligibility and e‑claims. | Ends surprise bills and front‑desk deposit games; speeds clean claims and patient flow. |
| **Wait‑Time Guarantees** | **Canada** | National **access standards** + a **Wait‑Time Guarantee**: travel voucher and **out‑of‑network at HTF rates** if thresholds are missed; provider enters corrective plan. | Converts “standards” into enforceable **patient rights**, not aspirations. |
| **Primary Care Teams (USF)** | **Portugal** | **Primary Care Teams (PCTs)** with risk‑adjusted capitation + **QIP bonuses** for continuity, panel sizing, and prevention. | Team‑based primary care improves access, quality, and prevention at lower cost. |
| **24/7 Nurse Triage & Teleconsults (SNS 24)** | **Portugal** | **NHP‑24** nationwide nurse line and teleconsults; publishes **ED‑deflection** and safety metrics. | Right care, right setting, faster; relieves emergency departments. |
| **Mandatory e‑Prescription + Centralized Procurement** | **Portugal** (and EU best practice) | **e‑Rx** with real‑time safety/fraud checks; **National Procurement Service** replaces PBM spread pricing with transparent tenders and fixed dispensing fees. | Lowers drug/device costs, improves safety, and eliminates PBM middle‑man skimming. |
| **ALD‑style Chronic Protection** | **France** | **Designated Chronic Conditions (DCC)** list: **zero co‑pays** for protocol‑based services tied to DCCs. | Keeps our co‑pay philosophy for routine care but removes barriers where adherence is critical. |

## What this means for people

- **Patients:** Any qualified doctor, **no up‑front payment**, clear co‑pays only, **wait‑time guarantees**, and zero co‑pays for protocol‑driven chronic care.  
- **Providers:** **Global budgets** (hospitals), **site‑neutral** outpatient pay, PCT option, fast e‑claims via **NHP Card**, and **quality bonuses** for results and compliance (incl. balance‑billing adherence).  
- **Taxpayers:** Hard **budget target**, sector **sub‑targets**, **clawbacks** when industry overshoots, centralized buys, and automatic **Core‑CPI** growth discipline.

## Where it lives in the bill (for counsel)
- **Guiding Principles:** §2(c)  
- **DCC zero co‑pay:** §4(d)(7)  
- **National Health Budget + Sector Sub‑Targets + Mid‑year adjustments:** §5(e)  
- **Global Budgets / Site‑Neutral:** §5(d)  
- **e‑Rx & National Procurement Service; PBM wind‑down; Safeguard clause:** §5(h)  
- **NHP Card; no advance payment; “co‑pays only” at POS; NHP‑24 triage:** §§5(j), 6(b)  
- **QIP + PCT model + compliance bonus:** §5(k)  
- **Access Standards + Wait‑Time Guarantee:** §5(l)

---

## Sound fiscal & operational guardrails
- **Core‑CPI indexation** across rates, caps, and triggers.  
- **Automatic adjusters** if reserves dip or projections miss (§5(g)).  
- **Capital Budget Board** to steer capacity where need is greatest (§5(e)(3)).  
- **HTA Office** to backstop evidence and pricing decisions (§6(d)).  
- **Balance‑billing ban** with real penalties; **Payment‑in‑Full** is the law (§6(b)).

*Result: a uniquely American hybrid that adopts the world’s most proven tools to deliver universal access, stronger primary care, disciplined spending, and predictable operations — without sacrificing provider choice or fiscal responsibility.*
