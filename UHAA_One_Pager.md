# Universal Healthcare Access Act of 2026 (UHAA) — One‑Pager

> A fiscally balanced, hybrid single‑payer that guarantees essential care for everyone, reins in prices, and preserves choice.

---

## What UHAA Does
- **Universal coverage** for essential services (modeled on Medicare benefits) for **all** citizens and lawful residents; non‑residents billed at cost + admin.
- **Hybrid model:** keep **supplemental private insurance** and **HSAs** for non‑essential services and amenities.
- **Free choice of providers:** no networks, no prior auth for essentials; telemedicine covered at parity (80% of in‑person reimbursement).

## How It’s Paid For (Four Pillars)
1. **UHAA Payroll** — employer **doubled** share (≈12.67% effective) + employee **5%–9.5%** band (floor at 105% FPL; cap 9.5%).  
2. **Medicare Realignment** — **HI payroll** + **Parts B/D general revenues** redirected to the HTF.  
3. **Medicaid MOE** — federal & state maintenance‑of‑effort dollars into the HTF.  
4. **Employer MOE** — replaces premiums: **≥7.5% of payroll** or prior‑year health spend (inflation‑adjusted).

> **Indexation:** Payment updates, caps, and automatic triggers are tied to **Core CPI** (not CPI‑M).

## Progressive Co‑Pays (OOP cap = 5% of AGI)
- **Low‑income**: $0 for essentials except modest ER/ambulance/hospital/day and $10 Rx;  
- **Middle**: PC $20, Specialist $50, Rx $20, Labs $10, ER $100;  
- **High / Very‑High**: **2× / 3×** middle co‑pays;  
- **Annual OOP** capped at **5% of AGI** (auto‑refunded above cap).

## Cost Controls (Built‑In)
- **All‑payer global hospital budgets** with growth cap **Core CPI + 0.5pp**.  
- **Site‑neutral** payments; facility‑fee limits for outpatient, imaging, labs, telehealth.  
- **HTF‑wide drug negotiation** (class‑based, cost‑plus, international reference pricing).  
- **Admin cap ≤7%**; AI‑assisted anti‑fraud with human oversight.

## Transition (Years 1–5)
- **Year 1:** Stand up HTF & Portal; publish site‑neutral schedule; pilot hospital budgets.  
- **Year 2:** Consolidate Medicare (HI + Parts B/D) into HTF; begin national global budgets; Employer MOE at **5%**.  
- **Years 3–4:** Raise Employer MOE to **7.5%**; complete Medicaid MOE; phase in mental health & vision parity.  
- **Years 2–5:** Phase out private insurance for essentials; preserve supplemental markets.
